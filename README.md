 Swiggy Case Study – Customer, Restaurant & Delivery Analytics (SQL)
📌 Project Overview

This project presents an analytics case study on Swiggy using Advanced SQL queries. 
The goal is to analyze customer behavior, restaurant performance, and delivery efficiency
to derive actionable insights that can help improve business strategies.

We leverage SQL techniques such as window functions, CTEs, subqueries, joins, aggregation, and ranking to answer real-world business questions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer ordering patterns (frequency, top cuisines, order value).

Identify top-performing restaurants and underperforming ones.

Assess delivery performance (average delivery time, late deliveries, delivery partner efficiency).

Provide recommendations for business growth and customer retention.

🛠️ Skills & Tools Used

Joins (INNER, LEFT, FULL)

Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

Subqueries & Correlated Subqueries

Window Functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER, NTILE, LEAD, LAG)

Aggregations (SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)

Case Statements & Conditional Logic

Database

MySQL / PostgreSQL (can be adapted to other RDBMS)
